# breast-cancer-ai-diagnosis
This project provides a deep learning-based tool for breast cancer detection using histopathology images. Users can upload an image, and the trained model predicts whether the tissue sample is cancerous or non-cancerous. The solution leverages modern image classification techniques to support medical research and diagnostic workflows.
